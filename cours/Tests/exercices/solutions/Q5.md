# Evaluation criteria

- The code was written following a TDD methodology as required
- The tests have descriptive naming
- The tests make meaningful assertions
- The tests have good coverage


# Suggested solution

In this exercise, you are free to implement the `Vector3` class with any TDD method you like. For
instance, you could start by writing a test for the `Vector3` constructor, then write the code to
make the test pass, then write a test for the `isZero` method, and so on. We provide an example
solution [here](Q5).

However, you should be cautious about the following:

- You should not write any new functionality before writing a failing test.
- You should not write tests that are too specific to the implementation, but rather tests that are
  more general and test the behavior of the class.

A common approach for TDD is the Red-Green-Refactor technique. In this approach, you write a
test, then write the code to make the test pass, then refactor the code. The refactoring pass must
not add any new functionality, but it may change the code to make it more efficient, more readable,
or more maintainable.

## Example tests

```Java
final class Vector3Test {

  @Test
  public void constructorAssignsCorrectComponents() {
    float x = 1.0f;
    float y = 2.0f;
    float z = 3.0f;
    Vector3 v = new Vector3(x, y, z);

    assertThat(v.x(), is(x));
    assertThat(v.y(), is(y));
    assertThat(v.z(), is(z));
  }

  @Test
  public void zeroIsZeroVector() {
    Vector3 v = Vector3.zero();

    assertThat(v.x(), is(0.0f));
    assertThat(v.y(), is(0.0f));
    assertThat(v.z(), is(0.0f));
  }

  @Test
  public void copyReturnsIdenticalCopy() {
    float x = 1.0f;
    float y = 2.0f;
    float z = 3.0f;
    Vector3 v = new Vector3(x, y, z);
    Vector3 vc = v.copy();

    assertThat(vc.x(), is(1.0f));
    assertThat(vc.y(), is(2.0f));
    assertThat(vc.z(), is(3.0f));
  }

  // Omitted for brevity
}
```
